# To Do List App

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Manager Project

- I created a **simple to-do list** using a Python list to store tasks, which helped me understand basic data structures.
  
- I broke the program into **three main functions**:
  - `addTask()` – to add tasks to the list
  - `deleteTask()` – to remove tasks
  - `listTask()` – to display all current tasks  
  ➤ This taught me how to organize code into logical, reusable parts.

- I implemented a **menu system** using a `while` loop with `if/elif` statements to control program flow and create a simple user interface.

- I added **error handling** using `try/except` blocks to manage invalid user inputs, which introduced me to the concept of defensive programming.

- I practiced **list operations** like `.append()` to add tasks and `.pop()` to remove them.

- **Key takeaways:**
  - How to structure a small but complete Python program
  - Working effectively with user input and output
  - Managing and manipulating list data
  - Handling errors gracefully
  - Writing clean, readable, and organized code

This project was a great beginner exercise. It used real-world concepts and helped me build a solid foundation in Python.  
I’m now confident to expand it by adding features like saving tasks to a file or assigning due dates.
