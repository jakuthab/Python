## Treasure Island Game 

# How it was implemented

- **While Loop Implementation:**
  - Used a `while` loop with a boolean flag (`treasure_not_found`) to control game flow
  - Learned how to create continuous gameplay until specific conditions are met

- **ASCII Art:**
  - Implemented multi-line string art using `r'''` (raw string)
  - Learned to create visually appealing game interfaces

- **Nested Conditional Statements:**
  - Created complex game logic using nested `if-elif-else` statements
  - Implemented multiple decision paths based on user choices

- **User Input Handling:**
  - Practiced getting and validating text-based user inputs
  - Learned to handle different case scenarios for user responses

- **Game Flow Control:**
  - Used the `break` statement to exit the game loop
  - Implemented multiple decision points with different outcomes

- **String Comparison:**
  - Learned to compare user input strings for decision making
  - Implemented `or` conditions for handling invalid inputs

This project helped me understand how to create an interactive text-based adventure game while practicing fundamental Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling. I also learned about creating engaging user experiences through story-based programming.
