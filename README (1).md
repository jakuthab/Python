# Password Generator 

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# Project Description

I created a Python Password Generator that builds secure, randomized passwords based on user preferences.  
The program asks users how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** they want, then generates a random combination accordingly.

# What I Learned

- **List Manipulation:**
  - Worked with multiple lists to organize letters, numbers, and symbols
  - Used `password_list.append()` to add characters to a list
  - Converted a list into a string using `''.join()`

- **Random Module:**
  - Used `random.choice()` to select random characters from lists
  - Applied `random.shuffle()` to mix the order of characters
  - Understood the role of randomness in creating secure passwords

- **For Loops:**
  - Used `for` loops with `range()` to control the number of each character type
  - Repeated code logic to match user-specified counts for letters, numbers, and symbols

- **User Input:**
  - Collected user input using `input()`
  - Converted string inputs into integers with `int()`
  - Used `f-strings` to create clear and dynamic user prompts

- **String Manipulation:**
  - Learned how to concatenate strings using `join()`
  - Combined different types of characters into a single password string

- **Type Annotations:**
  - Was introduced to Python’s `typing` module for type hints
  - Learned about the `@final` decorator (conceptually, though not directly used)

This project helped me apply and combine multiple core Python concepts—such as loops, lists, randomization, and input handling—to build a real-world tool.  
It also highlighted the importance of randomness in security and reinforced how user experience can be improved through clear prompts and struc
