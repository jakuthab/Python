# Encryption and Decryption project

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# Caesar Cipher Project – What I Learned

- I built a **Caesar Cipher program** that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages based on a user-specified shift.
- I used **functions** to organize the code and make it reusable (e.g. `caesar()` function).
- I learned how to:
  - **Import from other Python files** using `from art import logo` to display a custom logo.
  - Handle **user input** for direction (`encode` or `decode`), the message, and the shift number.
  - Use **lists** to manage the alphabet and handle character shifting.
  - Manage **non-alphabet characters** (like spaces, symbols, or numbers) so they are not altered in the output.
  - Apply **modulus (%)** to wrap around the alphabet when shifting letters beyond ‘z’.
  - Use **control flow** (`if`, `while`) to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.
  - Allow the program to **restart automatically** after each run with a simple `yes` or `no` prompt.

This project helped me understand how to apply loops, conditionals, and string manipulation to build a simple encryption tool.  
It also introduced me to modular programming and improved my ability to write clean, user-interactive Python scripts.
