Project Description: I created a Python Password Generator that creates secure, randomized passwords based on user specifications. The program asks users how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password and generates a random combination of these characters.

 What I Learned:

 List Manipulation:
 I learned how to work with multiple lists (letters, numbers, and symbols)
 I gained experience in appending elements to lists using password_list.append()
 I understood how to convert a list to a string using the join() method
 Random Module:
I learned to use random.choice() to select random elements from lists
I discovered random.shuffle() to randomize the order of elements in a list
I understood the importance of randomization in creating secure passwords
 For Loops:
I implemented for loops with range() to control the number of characters added
I learned how to iterate through specific ranges to add the desired number of each character type
User Input:
I practiced getting user input using input()
I learned to convert string inputs to integers using int()
I implemented f-strings for clearer user prompts
String Manipulation:
I learned about string concatenation using join()
I understood how to combine different character types into a single password string
Type Annotations:
I was introduced to the typing module and how to use type hints
I learned about the @final decorator (though not directly used in the main code)
This project helped me understand how to combine various Python concepts to create a practical application. It also taught me about the importance of randomization in security-related applications and how to create user-friendly interfaces through proper input handling and output formatting.

The concepts I incorporated demonstrate a good foundation in Python programming, from basic data structures to more advanced concepts like random number generation and type hinting.
