 Here's what I learned from this Pizza Order code:

Input Handling:

Using input() function to get user responses
Converting inputs to be case-insensitive using .lower()
Conditional Statements:

Using if, elif, and else for decision making
 Nested if statements for more complex conditions
Using logical operators for input validation
Variables:

Creating and updating variables (bill = 0)
Using a flag variable (valid_order) to track program state
String Formatting:

Using f-strings to display the final bill (f"Your final bill is: ${bill}.")
Basic Math:

# Using += operator for adding to the bill amount
# User Experience:

# Implementing error messages for invalid inputs
# Creating a clear pricing structure
# This code helped me understand how to build a simple order system and handle user inputs effectively in Python.
