# What I Learned from Creating the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

- **ASCII Art Implementation:**
  - Used multi-line strings (`'''`) to create visual game elements
  - Stored and displayed ASCII art using variables

- **List Operations:**
  - Used lists to store game choices (`rock`, `paper`, `scissors`)
  - Accessed list elements using index positions

- **Random Module:**
  - Used `random.randint()` to generate computer choices
  - Created randomized outcomes for gameplay

- **Conditional Logic:**
  - Built complex `if-elif` statements to handle game rules
  - Implemented logic for winning, losing, and draw outcomes
  - Handled invalid user input gracefully

- **User Input Handling:**
  - Practiced capturing and validating user input
  - Converted string inputs to integers using `int()`

- **Formatted Output (F-strings):**
  - Used f-strings to neatly format output messages
  - Combined variables with strings to give clear feedback to the user

This project helped me understand how to build an interactive game using core Python concepts like conditionals, user input, lists, and the `random` module.  
It also emphasized the importance of input validation and clear, engaging user feedback to improve the overall game experience.
