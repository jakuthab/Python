# Hangman Game


# What I Learned from Building the Hangman Game

 **Imports & Modules:**
  - Practiced modular programming by using multiple Python files
  - Imported specific components from other files
  - Used the `random` module for random word selection

- **Lists & Strings:**
  - Performed string manipulation and conversion between strings and lists
  - Used string methods like `.lower()` to standardize user input
  - Practiced list operations to update game state

- **Control Flow:**
  - Used `while` loops to keep the game running until a win or loss
  - Applied `if/else` logic to determine correct and incorrect guesses
  - Managed game continuation using boolean flags (e.g., `game_over`)

- **Variables & State Management:**
  - Tracked game state using variables like `lives` and `correct_letters`
  - Used placeholders to represent hidden letters
  - Managed multiple variables to reflect the game's progress

- **Functions:**
  - Utilized built-in functions like `len()` and `input()`
  - Applied `random.choice()` to select a word from a list

- **User Interface:**
  - Displayed visual feedback using ASCII art
  - Used f-strings for clear and dynamic messages
  - Collected and processed user input
  - Provided clear, consistent feedback messages to enhance gameplay

This project helped me understand how to build an interactive, text-based game using core Python concepts like control flow, functions, and modular programming.  
It also improved my ability to manage game state and provide a user-friendly interface.
